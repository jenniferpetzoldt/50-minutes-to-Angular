# 50-minutes-to-Angular

You have 50 minutes.
- [X] Create a static server from scratch, get a webpage on the DOM with AngularJS sourced, a la the lecture. This should be up and running on localhost:5000.

This should include an app called FoodApp and a controller called FoodController.

After that, make an input field, and bind it to a model. Show that 2 way data binding with the {{}}.

Lastly, add a button to the screen. When the button is clicked on, log the text from the input field to the console.

Use your notes, your peers, etc. Don't suffer too long -- You only have 50 minutes!

You can do it!
